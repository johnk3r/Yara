Yara rules to detect some threats affecting Latin America.


Hi Johnatan,

Welcome to the SBA Wargames Splunk Boss of the SOC (BOTS).  Please find below your personal credentials for the competition including the details for the Scoring system (do not share these details with anyone else, all other competitors will receive their own unique credentials).

Scoring Server: https://od-bots-fsibots-scoring.splunkoxygen.com
Team: Team 6
Username: user20-fsibot
Password: serious-shepherd

The Scoring server will provide your unique details for the gaming systems (Splunk instances with the data used to answer questions).  Credentials for Splunk and Phantom are the same as your scoring server credentials but please remember that UBA credentials are generic (bots/bots) for all users.

Please verify you have access to the scoring and associated gaming systems ahead of time and accept the User Agreement (you will not be able to answer questions once the competition starts if you have not accepted the agreement).  Please also verify your team assignment and personal details are correct in the email above as well as in the scoring server once you have logged in.

PLEASE NOTE: No questions will be visible or answerable until the start of the competition.

You should also have been invited to the Splunk Community Slack Workspace and have been added to the #sba-wargames channel, if you do not have access please let us know.  We will use Slack for all support and help during the event so please reach out for help when you need it.  Nick Crofts and myself (James Young) will be standing by during the event to assist as needed.

Anything else in the meantime please let us know.

Good luck for tomorrow and most importantly, remember to have fun!
